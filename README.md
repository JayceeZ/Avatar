FOR LEARNING PURPOSES
THIS CODE MAY CONTAIN A LOT OF BUGS

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISKS

This project is about learning basic to intermediate OpenGL stuff.

The final objective is to create a virtual avatar following the human body after people recognition with Asus kinect-like device.

Please don't judge any of this code as major part of it will be done on learning purposes only and will never reflect any commercial final product. You can feel free to reuse that code but you are not allowed to use it for commercial purposes.

Development is supposed to end by the end of May 2015.
No push/pull/merge requests will be handled until and after that time.
